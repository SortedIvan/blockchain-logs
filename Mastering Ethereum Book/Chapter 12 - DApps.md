# Decenralized Applications(DApps)

Smart contracts are a way to decentralize the controlling logic and payment functions of applications.
Web3 DApps are about decentralizing all other aspects of an application: storage, messaging, naming, etc.

letâ€™s take a closer look at the defining
characteristics and advantages of DApps.

What Is a DApp?
-
A DApp is an application that is mostly or entirely decentralized.
Consider all the possible aspects of an application that may be decentralized:
1. Backend software (application logic)
2. Frontend software
3. Data storage
4. Message communications
5. Name resolution

Each of these can be somewhat centralized or somewhat decentralized. For example, a
frontend can be developed as a web app that runs on a centralized server, or as a
mobile app that runs on your device. The backend and storage can be on private
servers and proprietary databases, or you can use a smart contract and P2P storage.

There are many advantages to creating a DApp that a typical centralized architecture
cannot provide:

>Resiliency
- >DApp backend will be fully distributed and managed on a blockchain platform. Unlike an application
deployed on a centralized server, a DApp will have no downtime and will continue to be available as long as the platform is still operating.

>Transparency
- >The on-chain nature of a DApp allows everyone to inspect the code and be more sure about its function. Any interaction with the DApp will be stored forever in the blockchain.

>Censorship resistance
- >As long as a user has access to an Ethereum node (running one if necessary), the user will always be able to interact with a DApp without interference from any centralized control. No service provider, or even the owner of the smart contract, can alter the code once it is deployed on the network.

Backend (Smart Contract)
-

Ethereum smart contracts allow you to build architectures in which a network of smart contracts call and pass data between each other, reading and writing their own
state variables as they go, with their complexity restricted only by the block gas limit.

One major consideration of smart contract architecture design is the inability to change the code of a smart contract once it is deployed. It can be deleted if it is programmed with an accessible SELFDESTRUCT opcode, but other than complete removal, the code cannot be changed in any way.

The second major consideration of smart contract architecture design is DApp size. A really large monolithic smart contract may cost a lot of gas to deploy and use. Therefore, some applications may choose to have off-chain computation and an external data source.

Having the core business logic of the DApp
be dependent on external data (e.g., from a centralized server) means your users will
have to trust these external resources.
