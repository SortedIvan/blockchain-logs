# Smart Contracts and Solidity

What Is a Smart Contract?
-
> immutable computer programs that run deterministically in the context of an
Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Ethereum network protocol—i.e., on the
decentralized Ethereum world computer.


- >Computer programs
Smart contracts are simply computer programs. The word “contract” has no legal
meaning in this context.

- >Immutable
Once deployed, the code of a smart contract cannot change. Unlike with tradi‐
tional software, the only way to modify a smart contract is to deploy a new
instance.

- >Deterministic
The outcome of the execution of a smart contract is the same for everyone who
runs it, given the context of the transaction that initiated its execution and the
state of the Ethereum blockchain at the moment of execution.

- >EVM context
Smart contracts operate with a very limited execution context. They can access
their own state, the context of the transaction that called them, and some infor‐
mation about the most recent blocks

- >Decentralized world computer
The EVM runs as a local instance on every Ethereum node, but because all
instances of the EVM operate on the same initial state and produce the same final
state, the system as a whole operates as a single “world computer.”

Life Cycle of a Smart Contract
-
Contracts only run if they are called by a transaction. All smart contracts
in Ethereum are executed, ultimately, because of a transaction initiated from an EOA.

A contract can call another contract that can call another contract, and so on, but the
first contract in such a chain of execution will always have been called by a transac‐
tion from an EOA. Contracts never run “on their own” or “in the background.”

- > Successful termination means that the program executed without an
error and reached the end of execution.

- > If execution fails due to an error, all of its
effects (changes in state) are “rolled back” as if the transaction never ran.

A failed
transaction is still recorded as having been attempted, and the ether spent on gas for
the execution is deducted from the originating account, but it otherwise has no other
effects on contract or account state.

It is important to remember that a contract’s code cannot
be changed.
However, a contract can be “deleted,” removing the code and its internal
state (storage) from its address, leaving a blank account.
Any transactions sent to that
account address after the contract has been deleted do not result in any code execu‐
tion, because there is no longer any code there to execute.

>To delete a contract, you
execute an EVM opcode called SELFDESTRUCT

>That operation costs “negative gas,” a gas refund, thereby incentivizing the release of network
client resources from the deletion of stored state

>If the contract’s code does not have a SELFDESTRUCT opcode, or it is inaccessible,
the smart contract cannot be deleted.

Introduction to Ethereum High-Level Languages
-
The EVM is a virtual machine that runs a special form of code called EVM bytecode,
analogous to your computer’s CPU, which runs machine code such as x86_64.Most Ethereum developers use a high-level language to write programs, and a compiler to convert them into bytecode.

While any high-level language could be adapted to write smart contracts, adapting an
arbitrary language to be compilable to EVM bytecode is quite a cumbersome exercise
and would in general lead to some amount of confusion.

- >LLL
A functional (declarative) programming language, with Lisp-like syntax. It was
the first high-level language for Ethereum smart contracts but is rarely used
today.

- >Serpent
A procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to
Python. Can also be used to write functional (declarative) code, though it is not
entirely free of side effects.

- >Solidity
A procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to Java‐
Script, C++, or Java. The most popular and frequently used language for Ethereum smart contracts.

- >Vyper
A more recently developed language, similar to Serpent and again with Pythonlike syntax. Intended to get closer to a pure-functional Python-like language than
Serpent, but not to replace Serpent.

- >Bamboo
A newly developed language, influenced by Erlang, with explicit state transitions and without iterative flows (loops). Intended to reduce side effects and increase auditability. Very new and yet to be widely adopted.

Building a Smart Contract with Solidity
-
Solidity was created by Dr. Gavin Wood.
In this chapter we will improve our Faucet contract

The Ethereum Contract ABI
-
An application binary interface is an interface between two pro‐
gram modules; often, between the operating system and user programs.

>An ABI
defines how data structures and functions are accessed in machine code

this is not to
be confused with an API, which defines this access in high-level, often humanreadable formats as source code.

In Ethereum, the ABI is used to encode contract calls for the EVM and to read data
out of transactions. The purpose of an ABI is to define the functions in the contract
that can be invoked and describe how each function will accept arguments and return
its result.

>A contract’s ABI is specified as a JSON array of function descriptions and events.

A function description is a JSON
object with fields type, name, inputs, outputs, constant, and payable. An event
description object has 
>fields type, name, inputs, and anonymous.

>All that is needed for an application to interact with a contract is an ABI and the
address where the contract has been deployed.

Selecting a Solidity Compiler and Language Version
-

Adding a version pragma is a best practice, as it avoids problems with mismatched
compiler and language versions.

Programming with Solidity
-

Data Types
-

First, let’s look at some of the basic data types offered in Solidity:

- >Boolean (bool)
Boolean value, true or false, 
with logical operators ! (not), && (and), || (or), == (equal), and != (not equal).

- >Integer (int, uint)
Signed (int) and unsigned (uint) integers, declared in increments of 8 bits from
int8 to uint256. Without a size suffix, 256-bit quantities are used, to match the
word size of the EVM.

- >Fixed point (fixed, ufixed)
Fixed-point numbers, declared with (u)fixedMxN where M is the size in bits
(increments of 8 up to 256) and N is the number of decimals after the point (up to
18); e.g., ufixed32x2.

- >Address
A 20-byte Ethereum address. The address object has many helpful member
functions, the main ones being balance (returns the account balance) and
transfer (transfers ether to the account).

- >Byte array (fixed)
Fixed-size arrays of bytes, declared with bytes1 up to bytes32.

- >Byte array (dynamic)
Variable-sized arrays of bytes, declared with bytes or string

- >Enum
User-defined type for enumerating discrete values: enum NAME {LABEL1, LABEL
2, ...}

- >Arrays
An array of any type, either fixed or dynamic: uint32[][5] is a fixed-size array of
five dynamic arrays of unsigned integers.

- >Struct
User-defined data containers for grouping variables: struct NAME {TYPE1
VARIABLE1; TYPE2 VARIABLE2; ...}.

- >Mapping
Hash lookup tables for key ⇒ value pairs: mapping(KEY_TYPE ⇒ VALUE_TYPE)
NAME.

In addition to these data types, Solidity also offers a variety of value literals that can
be used to calculate different units

- >Time units
The units seconds, minutes, hours, and days can be used as suffixes, converting
to multiples of the base unit seconds.

- >Ether units
The units wei, finney, szabo, and ether can be used as suffixes, converting to
multiples of the base unit wei.

Predefined Global Variables and Functions
-
Transaction/message call context
The msg object is the transaction call (EOA originated) or message call (contract ori‐
ginated) that launched this contract execution. It contains a number of useful
attributes:

>msg.sender:
- >It represents the address that initiated this contract
call, not necessarily the originating EOA that sent the transaction. If our contract
was called directly by an EOA transaction, then this is the address that signed the
transaction, but otherwise it will be a contract address.

>msg.value
- >The value of ether sent with this call (in wei).

>msg.gas
- >The amount of gas left in the gas supply of this execution environment. This was
deprecated in Solidity v0.4.21 and replaced by the gasleft function.

>msg.data
- >The data payload of this call into our contract.

>msg.sig
- >The first four bytes of the data payload, which is the function selector.

Whenever a contract calls another contract, the values of all the
attributes of msg change to reflect the new caller’s information.

>The
only exception to this is the delegatecall function, which runs
the code of another contract/library within the original msg
context.

Transaction context
-
The tx object provides a means of accessing transaction-related information:

> tx.gasprice
- > The gas price in the calling transaction

> tx.origin
The address of the originating EOA for this transaction. WARNING: unsafe!

Block context
-
The block object contains information about the current block:

> block.blockhash(blockNumber)
- >The block hash of the specified block number, up to 256 blocks in the past. Dep‐
recated and replaced with the blockhash function in Solidity v0.4.22.

- >block.coinbase
The address of the recipient of the current block’s fees and block reward.

>block.difficulty
- >The difficulty (proof of work) of the current block.

>block.gaslimit
- >The maximum amount of gas that can be spent across all transactions included in the current block.

> block.number
- >The current block number (blockchain height).

> block.timestamp
- >The timestamp placed in the current block by the miner (number of seconds
since the Unix epoch).

Address object
-

Any address, either passed as an input or cast from a contract object, has a number of
attributes and methods:

>address.balance
- >The balance of the address, in wei. For example, the current contract balance is
address(this).balance.

>address.transfer(amount):
- >Transfers the amount (in wei) to this address, throwing an exception on any
error. We used this function in our Faucet example as a method on the
msg.sender address, as msg.sender.transfer

>address.send(amount)
- >Similar to transfer, only instead of throwing an exception, it returns false on
error. WARNING: always check the return value of send

>address.call(payload):
- >Low-level CALL function—can construct an arbitrary message call with a data
payload. Returns false on error. WARNING: unsafe—recipient can (accidentally
or maliciously) use up all your gas, causing your contract to halt with an OOG
exception; always check the return value of call.
//OOG exception is Out Of Gas exception

Built-in functions
-
>addmod, mulmod
- >For modulo addition and multiplication. For example, addmod(x,y,k) calculates
(x + y) % k

>keccak256, sha256, sha3, ripemd160
- >Functions to calculate hashes with various standard hash algorithms.

>ecrecover
- >Recovers the address used to sign a message from the signature.

>selfdestrunct(recipient_address)
- >Deletes the current contract, sending any remaining ether in the account to the
recipient address.The address of the currently executing contract account.
