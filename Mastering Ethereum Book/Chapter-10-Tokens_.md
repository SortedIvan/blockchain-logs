# Tokens

Nowadays, “tokens” administered on blockchains are redefining the word to mean
blockchain-based abstractions that can be owned and that represent assets, currency,
or access rights.

Many blockchain tokens serve multiple purposes globally and can be traded for each other or for other currencies on the global liquid markets.

In this chapter, we look at various uses for tokens and how they are created. We also
discuss attributes of tokens such as fungibility and intrinsicality. Finally, we examine
the standards and technologies that they are based on, and experiment by building
our own tokens.

How Tokens are used
-

The most obvious use of tokens is as digital private currencies. However, this is only one possible use. Tokens can be programmed to serve many different functions, often overlapping. For example a token can simultaneously convey a voting right, an access right, and ownerhsip of a resource. As the following list shows, currency is just the first "app".

>Currency
- > A token can serve as a form of currency, with a value determined trough private trade

>Resource
- >A token can represent a resource earned or produced in a sharing economy or resource-sharing environment.

>Asset
- >A token can represent ownership of an intrinsic or extrinsic , tangible or intangible asset; for example gold, real estate, a car, oil, energy, MMOG items, etc.

>Access
- >A token can represent access rights and grand access to a digital or physical property, such as a discussion forum, an exclusive website, a hotel room, or a rental car.

>Equity
- >A token can represent shareholder equity in a digital organization(e.g., a DAO) or legal entity

>Voting
- >A token can represent voting rights in a digital or legal system.

>Collectible
- >A token can represent a digital collectible (e.g., CryptoPunks) or physical collectible(e.g., a painting)

>Identity
- >A token can represent a digital identity (e.g., avatar) or legal identity (e.g., national ID)

>Attestation
- >A token can represent a certification or attestation of fact by some authority or by decentralized reputation system (e.g., marriage record, birth certificate, college degree)

>Utility
- >A token can be used to access or pay for a service.

Often, a single token encompasses several of these functions. Sometimes it is hard to discern between them, as the physical equivalents have always been inextricably linked.
For example, in the physical world, a driver's license (attestation) is also an identity document (identity) and the two cannot be separated. In the digital realm, previously commingled functions can be separated and developed independently(e.g., an anonymous attestation).

Tokens and Fungibility
-

Tokens are fungible when we can substitute any single unit of the token for another
without any difference in its value or function.

Strictly speaking, if a token’s historical provenance can be tracked, then it is not
entirely fungible. The ability to track provenance can lead to blacklisting and white‐
listing, reducing or eliminating fungibility.

Non-fungible tokens are tokens that each represent a unique tangible or intangible
item and therefore are not interchangeable. For example, a token that represents
ownership of a specific Van Gogh painting is not equivalent to another token that rep‐
resents a Picasso, even though they might be part of the same “art ownership token”
system.

Each non-fungible
token is associated with a unique identifier, such as a serial number.
