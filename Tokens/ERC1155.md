# ERC-1155

> Sometimes, a company/person needs to create multiple tokens (of different types as well) that are held within the same smart contract. 

- The problem here is that both ERC20 and ERC771 are both single contract tokens which must be deployed seperately.
To overcome this, ERC-1155 introduces the ability to deploy multiple tokens at the same time in the same contract. This means both fungible and non-fungible tokens can reside within the same contract.

- ERC1155 also allows for a multi-token model, in which an account holds both fungible and non-fungible tokens. This is extremely useful, as it can be incorporated into liquidity pools. This way a user can deposit both a fungible and non fungible asset at the same time.
